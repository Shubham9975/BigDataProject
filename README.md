# **Amazon Customer Sales Pipeline**

## **1. Problem Statement**  
### **Title**: Analyzing Customer Sentiments and Trends in Amazon Reviews to Enhance Product Strategies  

### **Objective**  
The project aims to **leverage big data analytics** to gain actionable insights into **customer sentiments, product performance, and market trends** from the **Amazon Customer Reviews dataset**. By analyzing large-scale review data, we can better understand customer feedback, identify trends, and support **data-driven decision-making** for product improvement and strategic planning.  

### **Key Questions**  
1. **Sentiment Analysis**: What are the overall sentiments expressed in customer reviews for different products, and how do they vary by product category or brand?  
2. **Trend Analysis**: How do review trends (e.g., ratings, review volume) evolve over time? Are there any noticeable patterns?  
3. **Rating Distribution**: What is the distribution of ratings across different products? Are there specific products or categories that receive consistently high or low ratings?  
4. **Product Comparison**: How do different products or brands compare in terms of customer satisfaction and review metrics?  
5. **Demographic Insights**: If demographic data is available, how do different customer segments rate products and express sentiments?

## **3. Architecture Overview**  

### **Workflow**  
The project follows a structured **ETL pipeline** built on **AWS services** for **scalability, automation, and efficiency**.  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Ingestion (Amazon S3 - Data Lake)**  
- Raw customer review data is stored in **Amazon S3**.  
- This allows cost-effective, scalable storage for structured and unstructured data.  

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Cleaning (AWS Glue - ETL Processing)**  
- **AWS Glue Jobs** remove **duplicates, missing values, and inconsistencies**.  
- The cleaned dataset is stored back in **Amazon S3** for further processing.  

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Transformation (Amazon EMR + Apache Spark)**  
- **Apache Spark on AWS EMR** processes and restructures the data into three categories:  
  - **Customers Data** ‚Üí `s3://smalldataset1/customers/`  
  - **Products Data** ‚Üí `s3://smalldataset1/products/`  
  - **Reviews Data** ‚Üí `s3://smalldataset1/reviews/`  
- Data is saved in **Parquet format** for optimized querying.  

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Metadata Management (AWS Glue Crawler + Data Catalog)**  
- **AWS Glue Crawler** scans the processed S3 datasets.  
- The **AWS Glue Data Catalog** stores metadata for seamless querying.  

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Data Querying (Amazon Athena)**  
- **Athena** runs **serverless SQL queries** directly on structured S3 data.  
- This eliminates the need for a dedicated database.  

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Data Visualization (Power BI)**  
- **Power BI** connects to **Amazon Athena** for interactive dashboards.  
- Business insights include **customer sentiment trends, product performance, and rating analysis**.

## **7. Sample Queries for Amazon Athena**  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Get top 10 highest-rated products**
```sql
SELECT product_id, product_title, AVG(star_rating) AS avg_rating
FROM "smalldatabase"."reviews"
GROUP BY product_id, product_title
ORDER BY avg_rating DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
